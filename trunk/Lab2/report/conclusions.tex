In the 1D and 2D cases, the nonparametric approach performed much better, ingeneral, than the parametric approach.  In the 1D case, the parametric approach did produce an incredibly goodestimation when the assumed model closely matched the sample distribution. However, when the assumed model was incorrect and not well correlated to thesample data, the resulting estimation was poor.In the 2D case, similar results were observed.  The parametric approach workedwell for clusters that were close to guassian in shape, but performancedropped significantly for clusters of unusual shape (ie crescent-shaped).  Thenon-parametric approach is much more flexible because it does not assume astandard PDF but rather estimates it directly from the data.  This makes it amuch more powerful and robust estimation method in general, and hence it ispreferred in most cases.  The sequential discriminant approach attempts to classify the data bysequentially combining linear discriminants that get some part of the classexactly right.  The performance of this approach was very good, provided that theclasses are separable.  Under this condition, it is possible to get theclassification completely correct with very little overhead.
