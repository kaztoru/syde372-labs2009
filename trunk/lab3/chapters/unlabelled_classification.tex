The classification of unlabelled data is completed using the code presented in
Section \ref{sec:q5}. MATLAB actually provides a number of built in functions
for classifying data by k-means and fuzzy k-means
which are used extensively in this implementation.

MATLAB's \texttt{kmeans} and \texttt{fcm} functions are used to cluster the
provided data. Much of the remainder of the code in Section \ref{sec:q5} is
devoted to creating the plots in Figures \ref{fig:k-means-clear}, \ref{fig:k-means-multifuzz} and \ref{fig:k-means-gradientfuzz}.
