The purpose of this lab was to apply the classification algorithms and concepts learnt in the lectures to data sets in Matlab.  Parameters such as number of data points, means, covariance matrices,  and number of clustes were given.  The lab involved generating randomized clusters based on the class specifications, forming classification boundaries, and determining the probability of error based on those classification boundaries.
