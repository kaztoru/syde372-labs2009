The purpose of this lab was to apply pattern recognition classification
algorithms and concepts to data sets in Matlab.  Parameters such  as
number of data points, means, covariance matrices,  and number of clustes  were
given.  Randomized clusters were generated based on the class 
specifications, forming classification boundaries, and determining the
probability of error based on those classification boundaries.
