The previous report explored the idea of classification; how to categorize databased on pre-defined models. This report investigates the process of creatingmodels based on pre-classified data.Section \ref{sec:1d} explores the creation of 1-dimesional models. Section\ref{sec:2d} extends that work to 2-dimensions. Section \ref{sec:seq_est}describes the process of using sets of linear discriminants to create asequential classifier.
