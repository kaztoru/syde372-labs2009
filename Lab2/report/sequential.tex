When tested against the training data, the probability of error will be zero.
As opposed to parametric classifiers where the boundaries are generated from
the statistics of the sample, sequential discriminants form their boundaries by
ensuring that they capture each data point from the training set inside the
classifier. Thus, the training data will fall entirely into the correct
classifiers and the probability of error is zero.
