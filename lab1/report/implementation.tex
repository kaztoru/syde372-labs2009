The implementation for Lab 1 is done using MATLAB's class structures tomaximize the reusability and allow for experiementation beyond the requirementsof the lab. This is discussed further in Chapter \ref{cha:results}.\section{Classes}MATLAB classes were created for parametric and non-parametric classifiers. Theclasses, {\tt ParametricClass} and {\tt NonParametricClass} are presented inAppendix \ref{cha:code}.\subsection{Properties and class functions}The two classes store properties related to the pattern recognition problemsthey represent. The {\tt ParametricClass} stores for a class $A$ the values of$\mu_A$, $\Sigma_A$ and $p(A)$. The {\tt NonParametricClass} stores a clusterof $n$ points in a Gaussian distribution with the parameters $\mu$and $\Sigma$.Each class provides methods for calculating the various distance measuresassociated with the type of problem that it represents.\subsection{Static methods}\section{Helper functions}\subsection{Tools}\subsection{Plot ellipse}\section{Main file}
