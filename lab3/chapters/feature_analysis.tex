Cork would be most likely to be confused with other images such as grass, pigskin and paper. Its blocks are very similar to some blocks from the other three images, which indicate overlapping in the feature space and thus cause confusion.
Face and wood are to be most distinct. Face has the least variability in the horizontal directions, while cotton has very little variability in the vertical direction. They are thus far from other classes. In addition, the variability among each block of these figures are very similar, which indicates that the shape of these two classes are quite compact. Therefore, they are likely to be the most distinct ones, in the sense that it is neither very likely for their data to be misclassified, or other data to be misclassified as them.
