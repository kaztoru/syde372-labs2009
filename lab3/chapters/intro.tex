This report begins to explore some of the applications of pattern recognitionin real-world situations. Section \ref{sec:features} discusses a qualitativeanalysis of the features of a set of photographs which will be used througoutthe report. Section \ref{sec:labelled} discusses the classification ofpre-labelled data while Section \ref{sec:image} discusses the separation of acomposite image into its constituent parts. Finally, Section\ref{sec:unlabelled} discusses the clustering of unlabelled data.
